How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can easily go back to any previous version of a coding script. Any previous cahnges can be recovered easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: manually saving makes commit have a logical and clear purpose.
Cons: if you forget to commit, it will next commit difficult to understand.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

If multiple files are related, commiting multiple files makes sense. Google Docs save sepatately because two docs are unlikely to be related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows all commits you made, git diff compares two commits to see changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always recover the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save my coding files.
